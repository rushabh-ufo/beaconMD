# Back-End(GraphQL, Node JS, MongoDB, Google Cloud) Interview and Coding Challenge(GraphQL)
This documents describes an interview to be completed asynchronously by the Full Stack candidates.

This process is comprised of 3 stages:

- Technical Questions
- Coding Challenge
- Final Debrief

# 1- Technical Questions
In this phase the candidate must answer a series of questions through video. All questions are to be answered in the candidate's "own words", that is, no pre-scripted answers should be delivered.

## Instructions
- Capture a video in which the candidate continuously answers all questions in this section.
- The video should not be edited.
- Only a single video will be delivered.
- Answers in the candidate's own words; not scripted.
- The video should be no longer than 15-30 minutes. The shorter the better.

## The Questions
Answer the following questions in 15-30 minutes max. If you do not know the answer to a question, **clearly state so** and continue with the next one. Not all questions need to be answered.

- Describe your professional experience. This must include years in the field and any relevant information you may give.
- Describe your experience in the following technologies. This must include years of experience in EACH technology and any relevant information you may give.
- GraphQL, NodeJS, MongoDB, Typescript, Javascript
- Describe in your own words: What is Node.js? What is it used for?
- Describe in your own words: What is Event-driven programming?
- Describe in your own words: What is Event loop in Node.js work? And How does it work?
- Describe in your own words: What are Promises?
- Describe in your own words: What is REPL? What purpose it is used for?
- Describe in your own words: What is the basic difference between MySQL and MongoDB?
- Describe in your own words: How replication works in MongoDB?
- Describe in your own words: What is sharding in MongoDB?
- Describe in your own words: What is GraphQL and do you have experience?
- Describe in your own words: Explain the main difference between REST and GraphQL.
- Describe in your own words: Are there any disadvantages to GraphQL?

# 2- Coding Challenge
This a coding exercise to test knowledge and proficiency on GraphQL and Typescript. All code must be pushed to a git repository. In this challenge you will implement a small feature, covering the back end.

## Instructions
- Create a POC which covers Insert, Update and Fetch queries/mutation using GraphQL, Node JS(Express) and MongoDB. 

## Tech Stack
These are the technologies to be used. You can use additional libraries as you see fit.
- Git
- GraphQL
- Node JS(Express)
- MongoDB

## Deliverable
The deliverable consists of a zip file with a git repository and a working demo video.
